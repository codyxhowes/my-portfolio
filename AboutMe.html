            <p>Hi, My name is Cody Howes. I am 27 years old, and I am from Monroe, La.
            I have been working with web development for about 2 years now. 
            At first I dabbled while trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my computer science degree. 
            Once I figured out where I wanted to take career in computer science, I dove head first into web design. 
            I learned Git, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. 
            I try to learn something about each language every day by working on my own projects, reading, or watching videos. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of Javascript and plan to learn TypeScript, React, and Node.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I love graphic design, and making various genres of music. I have been a dedicated musician since 2012. I have played in a few bands, and in 2017 I started producing two projects that have been successful endeavors.</p>
            <p>My strengths are collaborating well with others, from my experience in bands and previous jobs I've held. I am good at finding creative solutions to problems. My main weakness is I can be too much of a perfectionist, and overly critical of myself.</p>
